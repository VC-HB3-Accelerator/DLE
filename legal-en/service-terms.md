# Digital Legal Entity Purchase and Service Terms

## 1. Licensing Model

### 1.1. Basic Principles

- **📜 License Type**: Single type - **Perpetual License**
- **⏳ Term**: Lifetime (no time limit)
- **💰 Price**: Depends on **number of tokens** in the license (see section 2)
- **🔄 Updates**: FREE for 5 years for license token holders
- **🚫 Cancellation**: License cannot be canceled by the company
- **⚖️ Service Terms**: Same for all licenses (difference only in number of votes)

### 1.2. Connection: Tokens ↔ Licenses

Each Digital Legal Entity license is linked to a **blockchain governance token**.

#### 📊 Token and Rights Ratio

| Parameter | For 1 token | For 10 tokens |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Number of licenses** | 1 | 1 |
| **Types of activity** | 1 | 1 |
| **Votes in voting** | 1 | 10 |
| **Service terms** | Same | Same |
| **Influence on development** | 1 vote | 10 votes |

#### 🗳️ Community Voting

- **Vote = 1 token** (regardless of number of tokens per owner)
- Voting occurs on **blockchain** (governance smart contract)
- Tokens give voting rights for **new features and development priorities**
- **Democracy**: Decisions are made by majority vote (51%+)

### 1.3. Type of Activity and Usage

- Each license is tied to **one type of activity/business**
- Owner can redefine the type of activity, but can only maintain one at a time
- For multiple types of activity, separate licenses and tokens are needed

- **ERC20Permit**: Signatures for token transfers without gas fees (meta-transactions)

**Creating a proposal:**
- Only token holders (licenses) can create proposals
- Description: Text of proposal for new feature
- Voting duration: From 1 hour to 30 days
- Target networks: Can be executed in one or multiple networks simultaneously

**Voting Process:**
1. Proposal is created and receives unique ID
2. Token holders vote "For" or "Against"
3. Each token = 1 vote (regardless of holder)
4. Quorum is checked at deadline or when 51%+ is reached

**Proposal Execution:**
- If "For" > "Against" AND quorum reached → proposal accepted
- Execution can be through:
  - Direct call (in voting chain)
  - Through signatures (in other networks)


### 9.3. Security and Limitations

✅ **Reentrancy Protection** - ReentrancyGuard in all critical operations  
✅ **Direct Transfer Blocking** - tokens transferred only through governance  
✅ **Vote Snapshots** - past values used to protect against flash-loans  
✅ **EIP-712 Signatures** - support for contract wallets and meta-transactions  
✅ **Operation Validation** - all parameters checked before execution

### 9.4. License Transfer
