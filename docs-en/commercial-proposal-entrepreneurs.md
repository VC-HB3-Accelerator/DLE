**Result:** clients reduce operational costs by 30%+ and save time on disputes over documents or payment delays.

## ⚖️ LEGAL COMPLIANCE

**Important clarification on regulatory restrictions:**

Regulators **prohibit:**
- TRADING operations with tokenized assets (buying/selling as securities)
- Selling goods/services for cryptocurrency

But **DO NOT prohibit** using tokenization for **INTERNAL accounting:**

✅ Product inventory accounting  
✅ Logistics and movement tracking  
✅ Security and access control  
✅ Internal asset management

**Core functionality (CRM, AI, management) is fully legal** regardless of tokenization.

*For more on how regulatory restrictions are lifted through L2 solutions, see the "PROSPECTS AND ECOSYSTEM" section below.*

We recommend consulting with a lawyer about token trading operations and crypto payments in your country.

## 🚀 PROSPECTS AND ECOSYSTEM

**VC HB3 Accelerator** — a venture fund creating a global asset tokenization ecosystem.

**How we lift regulatory restrictions:**

The fund offers regulators to implement a ready L2 solution at its own investment cost with regulator participation. This enables:
- Creating regulated infrastructure for asset tokenization
- Lifting restrictions on token trading within a regulated ecosystem
- Allowing goods/services sales for cryptocurrency through a regulated L2 chain
- Ensuring full regulator control over infrastructure

**Development plans:**
- 21,000+ entrepreneurs in the first accelerator
- 600 portfolio companies over 5 years
- 100+ offices in different countries
- Cooperation with regulators for L2 solution implementation
- Investments in accelerator participants

**But importantly:** The software can be used **independently of fund status and regulator work**. Even if the fund doesn't register or reach agreements with regulators, the software remains yours — this is guaranteed. Internal accounting through tokenization works legally in any case.
