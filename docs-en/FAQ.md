**ROI**: 1,117% on DLE investment
**Payback**: < 1 month

### What hidden costs does DLE have?

**One-time costs**:
- License: $1,000-10,000 USDT
- Smart contract deployment: $100-500 (gas fees)
- Setup: $0 (free setup by contractors within 5 years included in license)

**Monthly costs**:
- Hosting: $50-200/month

### How to calculate savings for my business?

**Calculation formula**:
```
Savings = (Turnover × 0.03) + (Employees × 2000) + (Investments × 0.1)

Where:
- 0.03 = 3% bank fees
- 2000 = $2,000/year per employee (management)
- 0.1 = 10% of attracted investment amount
```

**Example for small business** (turnover $100,000, 3 employees):
- Bank fees: $3,000
- Management: $6,000
- **TOTAL**: $9,000/year savings
- **ROI**: 900% on $1,000 license
